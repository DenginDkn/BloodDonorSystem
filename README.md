## Design, Assumptions, and Issues

### Design

The Blood Donor System is designed as a web-based application to facilitate blood donation processes. The front-end is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system follows a client-server architecture, with the client-side handling user interactions and the server-side managing data storage and retrieval.

### Assumptions

- Users have a basic understanding of the blood donation process.
- The system is accessible to the public, with specific features requiring authorization (if applicable).
- No backend server is used for simplicity.

### Issues Encountered

- **Styling Consistency:** Ensuring consistent styling across different pages was challenging due to the absence of a front-end framework. This was addressed by creating a shared CSS file for common styles.
- **Data Persistence:** As the system doesn't have a backend, data is not persisted between sessions. This limitation is intentional for the sake of simplicity.
